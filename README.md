# Knoxx SBash
A bash wrapper that limits Root functionality and firejails all programs.

I will be adding more functionality and extensibility to this program, but the main purpose is to prevent users from doing less than intelligent tasks, including, at a later point, deleting their HOME, BIN, ETC, or other critical folders. This wrapper will also attempt to harden parts of the system with user input.
